            "O honored son of █████, protect us from this wretched dragon!" a strange voice calls upon you. You are missing an arm and have nothing on you. Your mighty armor and weapons had been destroyed in the recent battle against ██████, yet still, bereft of so much, you decide to help the town and slay this loathsome beast. Perhaps consumed by your intense hatred of all dragons, or perhaps your desire for it all to cease, you had never questioned the origins of this voice.
